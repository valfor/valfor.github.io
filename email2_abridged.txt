Emperor Theoden,

This is Valfor Talleyrand from the LKE again. I just wanted to inform you that you have not logged in to your account since July 31 and you haven't logged in to your nation for 33 days as of this email.

I hope everything is OK with you. There have been rather important developments and I think it would be good to have your thoughts and insight on them.

If you can and are able, please logon and keep us apprised of your situation.

Humbly,
Valfor Talleyrand
