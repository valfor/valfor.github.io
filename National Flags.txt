Greetings. One very minor thought that occurs to me is that it may look slightly better to some nations (on the region page) if we have a variety of flags used by the Regional Officers, rather than one or more flags being the same between the RO nations. Obviously, the flags used are generally different, but you and I both use the Golden Eagle as our flag. When I look at other major regions (the GCRs and Europeia), they tend to have different custom flags for each of the different RO nations. 
I use the Golden Eagle on my nation as it is the nation from which recruitment telegrams are sent.
As the flag of the sending nation appears on the right hand bar in the telegram box, within the inbox. 
I was wondering if you think this point makes sense, in terms of the aesthetic impression, and, if so, if changing the flag of Valfor would be a possibility? It could be a custom flag of your own design (like that of Valfor or Akillian) or a flag that incorporates the Golden Eagle in it (like NES's, or one of the colonial flags) - or even one of the less usual/more varied national flags might be suitable.
It's not really important, however, so if you would prefer to keep the same flag, don't worry about it.
Thanks.

Alright, I shall do that shortly. About the flag, I have historically used a version of the US Virgin Islands flag, but changed it to the LKE flag some time ago, not because I felt I needed to, but rather just wanted to

Thank you. Possibly may be worth switching back, though I am not sure if it really matters - depends on your view of how new nations perceive the same flags among the RO nations. If you do switch, possibly worth waiting a few days to do so, if you are posting on the NS forums with Valfor shortly, so the LKE flag appears next to the post (though the position listed in your forum signature will identify you as LKE in any case - worth making sure the forum signature is up to date with your current position).

Greetings
On another matter, I was wondering if you had an opportunity to give thought regarding my earlier question concerning whether you could use a custom flag for your LKE nation, so we don't have two ROs appearing with the LKE flag (as I need to keep the LKE flag up, as my nation sends the recruitment telegrams via the API and the flag appears on the right-hand side next to telegrams)? Preferably a flag other than the one that used to be Cephal's flag, if possible. 
If not, no worries, as it is not particularly urgent or important in any case.

Incidentally, to check up, I don't suppose you have had an opportunity to give this flag matter further thought? If ultimately changing it's not practical, don't worry.

I haven't forgotten, I still need to find a replacement

OnderKelkia — 08/23/2020
With regard to national flags - I am sorry to keep raising the issue - but I have a slight concern that the style of the eagle in the new flag could be misperceived by some - not with the slightest basis of course, but we should try and ensure the front of house, so to speak, is as unlikely to be misperceived as possible.

Valfor Talleyrand — 08/23/2020
That is a copy of the original flag for the nation of Valfor

OnderKelkia — 08/23/2020
Indeed, I don't think it is substantively problematic at all
So I wouldn't have any concern about it as an individual national flag
My concern is just how it might appear to some new nations - to a certain extent, ignorant nations - looking at the ROs on the region page
I mean, it should be fine to keep it up if you think that is the best one - it is basically the US Virgin Islands flag
I only raise the point out of an abundance of caution and purely from a perception perspective.

Valfor Talleyrand — 08/23/2020
Have you received any telegrams of anyone thinking you were Valfor? I have not received any telegrams of people thinking I was Onderkelkia. If I may, I'd like to keep this one

OnderKelkia — 08/23/2020
The possibility of Onderkelkia being confused with Valfor was not the issue with either the original flag (or this one).
The issue with the original flag was aesthetically, having two LKE flags on RO nations looks a little less varied, in terms of what new nations see. More variation looks better - not specifically because of the risk of one individual being confused for the other in terms of telegrams they receive, but how it looks at a glance to new nations. 
As for this flag, as I said above, " it should be fine to keep it up if you think that is the best one".
The point solely is that that the main criterion for assessing these flags should be what looks best to new nations.
