I have determined that Imperial Army units will no longer be permitted to participate, either as individuals or when representing another organisation, in operations involving organisations with which the LKE Imperial Army will not itself cooperate. This presently includes all prescribed organizations and Brotherhood of Malice. See the list below. More clearly, units must not participate, neither under the banner of the LKE, nor under any other banner or on a personal decision, in any operation where one of the below organizations is present.
As a reminder and until further notice, all cooperation with TBH or LWU is conditioned on my express consent. They are however not covered by the above rule.

The Ascendancy
Founderless Regions Alliance
Founderless
United Defenders League
Yggdrasil
The Order of the Grey Wardens
The Kingdom of Great Britain
The Empire of Mare Nostrum
The Rejected Realms
New Roman Imperium
Osiris
Brotherhood of Malice
Auralia
Victrix

I want to make clear that transgressing this rule constitutes a motive for exclusion from the Imperial Army.
