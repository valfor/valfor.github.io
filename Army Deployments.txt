What is going on with https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_third_coalition ?

I believe that would be the target of the most recent major. I wasn't made aware of it until now
I will post reinforcement orders

OnderKelkia — 07/19/2020
Thank you.
We should ensure that, whenever the LKE is involved in a successful raid leading to an occupation, reinforcement orders are issued either at the update or as soon as possible after the update without exception, or else there is an increased risk of 'liberation' in a scenario where the LKE's name is at stake owing to being on the WFE.

Greetings. Particularly given the situation with TBH, it is absolutely vital we demonstrate our value and get a large, impressive showing quickly in this operation with Europeia
Did Europeia offer us an RO?
In Calefacta Aquas Piscinae

Valfor Talleyrand — 08/23/2020
No

From the orders issued, would I be right in thinking that Europeia has now been in communication? 
If so, when did they get in contact?
Valfor Talleyrand — 12/18/2020
Yes, I received a message from Otto/Kazaman about 2 hours ago (was still working at the time) but confirmed they want reinforcements still even though Prim is their delegate. Otto/Kazaman said they'd like to be able to increase their endorsements among natives
OnderKelkia — 12/18/2020
Rather unusual that they would seek assistance after the delegacy transition has been completed.
We can do that for a few days, but it seems a little pointless if the delegacy transition is already completed.
Unusual on their part that is.
If it is just a matter of boosting his endorsements, we could well be using our military units bolstering our own endorsements
Rather than helping Euroepia pad their figures while they grow their native numbers
That being said, as they have requested help and made clear that they still want it post-transition, we should provide it, at least for the time being, to be kept under review according to other operational demands.
We should ensure we have a sizeable and impressive display of LKE flags for the occasion.

With regard to the Europeia mission, I assume Europeia asked us to approach individual updaters rather than to put a general advertisement out?

Valfor Talleyrand — 01/31/2021
Yes, that's correct

OnderKelkia — 01/31/2021
Do we have any idea yet who we might have available?
Balder can't do the Europeia operation, so it would be particularly helpful if there can be a good LKE showing

Valfor Talleyrand — 01/31/2021
Alright
I did confirm with Kazaman btw and I will be asking around hopefully today

OnderKelkia — 01/31/2021
Very good, hopefully we will have some units.
