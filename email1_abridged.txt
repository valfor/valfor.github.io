Greetings Theoden,

This is Valfor Talleyrand from the LKE reaching out to you. It is Friday, March 13, 2020 - probably early Saturday morning, March 14, 2020 for you.

I hope you are able to receive this email as it is a bit abnormal to reach out like this. How are you doing? You have not logged in on the LKE Forums since 22 January 2020 and your nation will soon CTE.

Just so you are aware, if you do not return, the Emperor Emeritus, and together with the Guardian Council, may have to declare a regency in light of your extended absence without notice of leave. If you are able, you may reply to this email and I will forward communication so that our region and its citizens can know.

Thank you,
Valfor Talleyrand
