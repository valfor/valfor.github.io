Greetings
I see you have released an honors list. While I have no objection to your batch of awardees, I prefer that matters such as the determination of grant of honors including peerages, be run with me first the next time around, especially since I am not on leave

With all due respect, you have been sick, and an absence has been felt whether there is an official leave posted or not. In addition, it isn't helpful that Crown Prince Akillian has been inactive as of late as well. Our elections were also 5 days delayed. I have acted according to and within the delegated powers - nothing was done to sideswipe the Crown, and I was careful and meticulous to make sure what I did was necessary and proper and also according to precedent to confer Peerage on outgoing Prime Ministers of several terms. However, in the future, I will make sure to run things like this by you.

I was referring specifically to the grant of the peerage in the recently released batch of imperial honors. While you are correct to point out that it has been our convention to award peerages to outgoing prime ministers, I was not inclined to do so for Rayregalia considering his last term in Layton. However, I appreciate you mentioning that future awards of peerages would be consulted first, especially when in your judgment I am not able to do them personally whatever my prevailing circumstances be at that time
Since you have mentioned Akillian, I have been meaning to talk to you about the possibility of upgrading you to Crown Prince after him. Of course, this discussion is just between you and me for the moment. I have not been able to talk with Akillian in full yet, at least, as far as confirming whether he can still stay on. But his inactivity has been a cause for concern. And while I would hate for him to leave, we should be preparing for any eventuality.
