May I ask the rationale for removing Rayregalia?

Sure, I thought his activity level and the demand of other things like the President of the Council of Rulers were not conducive to the Crown. He hasn't been able to execute the duties of Mayor. More specifically, there were two requests for new organizations that he hadn't attended to, and I thought it best to discharge him from those duties. I hold no prejudice from him having the office in the future.

Thank you, I understand. Rayregalia approached me with some concerns regarding the matter - specifically claiming that he hadn't been notified beforehand. I referred him to Emperor Theoden and you to discuss it further. Emperor Theoden mentioned to me then that he hadn't been aware of the decision - which is a problem, reflecting a lack of necessary communication, as he should be involved as Emperor in appointments decisions personally barring a leave of absence or an emergency, whatever the cause of the lack of communication - but given his circumstances, I don't believe he has been able to discuss the matter with you since to clarify the way forward. 
On the substantive issue, perhaps the best way forward, in relation to the Mayoral position, would be to reinstate Rayregalia, but to direct him to appoint a Deputy who could share and assist in discharging his responsibilities, and to be more attentive to quickly responding to things such as organisation requests.
As a more general point, when dismissing someone, it is best to talk to them before announcing it, unless they are inactive or there is a serious misconduct issue, to avoid any ill will from the decision.

Indeed, Emperor Theoden hasn't spoken to me about it yet. I had mentioned the situation (prior to the notice) to him, so he was aware of how I felt of Rayregalia's performance. I of course can talk to Theoden more about it if/when he becomes more available. I can also talk to Rayregalia directly, but for the time being and absent a bonafide reassurance from him, I said that I could execute those duties until then or if we found someone else suitable

He may have been aware of your feelings about Rayregalia's performance, but that is distinct from him being aware of the specific decision to exercise a delegated power of the Emperor to dismiss Rayregalia. As I think Emperor Theoden clarified in relation to the previous University Chancellor issue, barring an emergency requiring an immediate decision or a leave of absence on his part, he prefers to be involved in personnel decisions and, in ordinary circumstances, not all of the delegated powers are intended to be used to their fullest extent without consultation (some powers, like citizenship, should be used routinely; others are there to cover for circumstances where he is unavailable, but aren't meant to be used autonomously when he is available). Possibly this requires further clarification to avoid misunderstanding.
On the substantive issue of Rayregalia's appointment, I don't have any view on the merits of who the Mayor of Onderford should be - you and Emperor Theoden are much better placed than I to judge that. I am, however, conscious that these kinds of decisions should be taken carefully and in a way that is sensitive to wider regional dynamics. That is why I am wondering if it would be better to restore matters to Rayregalia holding the mayoralty: the status quo ante, so to speak, until such time as permanent arrangements going forward can be established - whether that is keeping Rayregalia under more stringent conditions or replacing him with an alternative successor.
