Those were the main two matters that I know Emperor Theoden wished to address, but in relation to which technical problems have impeded him. There is another possible matter.
Peeps of Europeia has been regularly checking the forum.
Has he been trying to communicate with you?
If not, then I am pretty sure that he has been sent by Europeia to speak to Theoden, and has not received a reply as of yet.

No, I haven't heard from Peeps in a while. I've spoken to Kazaman on discord

I think it is most likely regarding a separate non-military matter.
It may be sensible for you to drop a PM to Peeps explaining that you've noticed that he has been checking the forum, that you have been wondering if he is trying to contact the LKE and noting that Emperor Theoden is currently experiencing interruptions in his internet availability, and asking generally if there is anything you can help him with.

Sure can do

Hey Peeps! I've noticed that you have been checking the LKE forum, and I was wondering if you are trying to contact the LKE? Emperor Theoden is currently experiencing interruptions in his internet availability. Is there anything I can help you with?

Peeps — 01/30/2021
Nope! Looking around.
Thanks for checking though!

Any news/progress/developments on any of the above matters? 
Separately, in relation to the Europeia operation, do we know who we have attending?

Peeps said he had nothing. I haven't had the chance to talk with Akillian yet, but I see he is online now

Very good - strange to see Peeps lurking about the forums then, but good to know we weren't missing anything
